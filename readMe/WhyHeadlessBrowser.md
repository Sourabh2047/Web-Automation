There is a lot of advantages in using Headless Browsers. Some of tham are as follows:

* A definite advantage of using Headless Browsers is that they are typically faster than real browsers. The reason for
  being faster is because we are not starting up a Browser GUI and can bypass all the time a real browser takes to load
  CSS, JavaScript and open and render HTML DOM.
* Performancewise you can typically see a 2x to 15x faster performance when using a headless browser.
* While Scraping Websites you don’t necessarily want to have to manually start up a website. So you can access the
  website headlessly and just scrape the HTML. You don’t need to render a Full Browser to do that.
* Lot of developers use a Headless Browser for unit testing code changes for their websites and mobile apps. Being able
  to do all this from a command line without having to manually refresh or start a browser saves them lots and effort.
